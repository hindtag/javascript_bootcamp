# How to Approach

1. Run the outer for loop for how many number of times you are having the lines.
   - No. of lines is equal to no. of rows
   - No. of times outer loop will run
2. Identify how many columns are there with each row.
3. Initiate the variable for the number of rows
4. Code the outer loop for the needed rows
5. Print the space for the outer loop
6. Code the inner loop for the needed column
7. Print the symbol for the inner loop
8. Console log/Print

## Note:

- Outer for loop are for rows
- Inner for loop are for columns
